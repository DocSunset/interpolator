This repository currently contains an implementation of Martin Marier's
"intersecting n-spheres interpolation" algorithm.  The implementation is a
header-only C++ library, and includes several example programs using it.  Both
the library and the examples are written in a literate programming style using
[lilit](https://github.com/DocSunset/lilit).  A pretty-printed HTML version of
the literate source code can be downloaded from the docs folder.  Additional
preset interpolation algorithms may eventually be added as well.

This is work in progress, and the ultimate fate of this code is still
uncertain.  For now, all applicable rights are reserved.  If you would like to
use this code, please contact me at travis at traviswest dot ca.
